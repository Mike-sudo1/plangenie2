# PlanGenie2

PlanGenie2 is a minimal Expo + React Native layout for testing in Expo Go.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the Expo development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
3. Open the project in Expo Go to preview the layout.

The app currently includes:
- A bottom tab navigator with Plan, Explore, and Profile screens.
- A shared header component displaying the "PlanGenie" title.
- Soft pastel styling for the background and tab bar.

This scaffold is ready for future feature work without any API integrations or complex logic yet.
